# Jarvis
What you have before yourself is a simple To-Do application. On it's own it can't do much
( Try adding a task and see for yourself ), but in the hands of right developer it has the potential to be AWESOME !!

<i> App currently only supports addition of an item to todo list , not exactly jarvis :p</i>
